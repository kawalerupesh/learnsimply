            <h3>Introduction </h3>
            <span><br />
                Bootstrap is an open-source and free CSS framework that helps in directing <br />a responsive
                device-friendly mobile-first front-end webpage development<br /> tool. This tutorial series will teach
                you about Bootstrap and its various features.

                    <h5>What is Bootstrap</h5>

                    Bootstrap mainly includes CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and an optional<br /> JavaScript-supported
                    design template (plug-ins) that deals with typography,<br /> buttons, forms, and other user
                    interface components. This Bootstrap framework<br /> helps rapid web development and supports
                    developers in creating responsive<br /> web pages.

                    <h5>History of Bootstrap</h5>
                    Twitter Blueprint was the first name for Bootstrap and was developed on Twitter <br />by Mr. Mark
                    Otto and Jacob Thornton. It was released as an open-source product<br /> on GitHub in August 2011.
                    The framework is primarily built to encourage design <br />uniformity and reliability of web pages
                    across applications. Before its existence,<br /> developers used various external libraries to
                    perform responsive web development,<br /> leading to incompatibilities in web development and heavy
                    maintenance burdens.

                files, logically grouping common resources and providing both <br />compiled and minified variations.
