      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>HTML is the standard markup language and is used to create Web pages.

        It was created by Tim Berners Lee and released in 1993.</p>
      <h3>Tag's in html</h3>

      <b>
        &lt;tagname&gt;ðŸ‘ˆ Opening Tag
        </br></br>

        &lt;/tagname&gt; ðŸ‘ˆ Closing Tag
        </br><br />
        &lt;br&gt;ðŸ‘ˆ This tag is used for break line.</p>
      </b>
      The main parts of our element are as follows:<br />
      <br />
      <b>The opening tag</b>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
      angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect â€” in this case where the paragraph
      begins.<br /><br />
      <b>The closing tag</b>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the
      element name. This states where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing
      tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br /><br />
      <b>The content</b>: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br /><br />
      <b>The element</b>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <h3>Attributes</h3>
      Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here,
      class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the
      element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value)
      with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.
      <br /><br />
      Attributes that set a value always have:
      <br /><br />
      1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more
      attributes).<br /><br />
      2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.<br /><br />
      3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.<br /><br />
      <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
      You can put elements inside other elements too â€” this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is
      very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to be
      strongly emphasized:
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b> &lt;p&gt;My cat&lt;strong&gt;is very grumpy.&lt;br&gt;</p></b>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h3>Void elements</h3>
      <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already have
        in our HTML page:</p>
      <br />
      <hr>
      <b> &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" &gt;</b>
      <br /><br />
      <hr>
      <b>Anatomy of an HTML document :</b>
      That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how
      individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html
      example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):
      <br /><br />
      <hr><b>
        &lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
        &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;<br />
        &lt;head&gt;<br />

        &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br />
        &lt;/head&gt;<br />
        &lt;body&gt;<br />
        &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;<br />
        &lt;/body&gt;<br />
        &lt;/html&gt;<br />
        <hr>
      </b>
      <br /><br />
      Here, we have the following:
      <br />
      <b>&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> â€” doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
      (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be
      considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they
      don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to
      know for now.<br /><br />
      <b>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</b> â€” the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page
      and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of
      the document.<br /><br />
      <b>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</b> â€” the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff
      you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes
      things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content,
      character set declarations, and more.<br /><br />
      <b>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</b> â€” This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which
      includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual
      content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later
      on.<br /><br />
      <b>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</b> â€” This viewport element ensures the page renders
      at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then
      shrinking them down.<br /><br />
      <b>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</b> â€” the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page, which is the
      title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you
      bookmark/favorite it.<br /><br />
      <b>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</b> â€” the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show
      to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or
      whatever else.<br /><br />
      <h3>Images :</h3><br />
      Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img&gt; element again:
      <br />
      <hr>
      <b>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</b>
      <hr>
      <br />
      As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source)
      attribute, which contains the path to our image file.<br /><br />
      <h3>Paragraphs :</h3>
      <p>As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when
        marking up regular text content:</p>
      <br />
      <hr>
      <b>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</b>
      <hr>
      <br /><br />
      <h3>List :</h3>
      <br />
      A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of
      at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:<br />

      1.<b>Unordered lists </b>: are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list.
      These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; element.&lt;br/&gt;<br />
      <hr><b>
        &lt;ul&gt;<br />
        &lt;li&gt;samosa&lt;li&gt;<br />
        &lt;li&gt;Paneer&lt;li&gt;<br />
        &lt;li&gt;paneer-fry&lt;li&gt;<br />
        &lt;li&gt;Soyabene-fry&lt;li&gt;<br />
        &lt;ul&gt;<br /><br />
      </b>>
      2.<b>Ordered lists </b>: are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are
      wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt; element.
      <hr>
      &lt;ol&gt;<br />
      &lt;li&gt;watch&lt;li&gt;<br />
      &lt;li&gt;T-shirt&lt;li&gt;<br />
      &lt;li&gt;Shoes&lt;li&gt;<br />
      &lt;li&gt;mobile&lt;li&gt;<br />
      &lt;ol&gt;<br />
